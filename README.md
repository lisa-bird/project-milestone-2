The second milestone project calls for an interactive front-end website. The website will need to respond to the users actions, allowing users to actively engage with data and alter the way the website diplays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

# Owners Goal
To encourage fun and test users knowledge and memory about the 90s era.

# Audience

The audience will be both male and female, aged 25 and over. Groups/ teams can battle it out to get be the winner, with the most points. 

# UX
## The Strategy
Business goals include gaining traffic to the website. Ultimately, for the user to find the quiz enjoyable and fun. Whether that be to test their own knowledge of the 90's or to flare up their competitive streak with friends/family, to see who gets the highest score. To capture the attention of the audience the website has:
* Easy to use game play.
* Instructions of how to play.
* A score board, showing correct and incorrect scores.
* Bright consistent colours with a 90's garish theme.
## The Scope
To achieve an interaction, allowing users to actively engage with the data displayed the website includes:
* Call to action 'Start' button, displays the multiple choice questions.
* Call to action 'Next' button, to move to the next question.
* Clear instructions.
* Message to user when answered correct/incorrect.
* Colour changing backgrounds when answered correct/incorrect.
* Time out alert.
* Game over alert.
* Incrementing score board.
## The Structure
The information displayed on the website is structured in a logical way. The landing page clearly shows the instructions of how to play the quiz and how the user can navigate through the quiz. The call to action 'Start' button is bold enough be easily seen. 
In gameplay the container holds the questions and answers, with a visible timer counting down 10 seconds. The 'next' button is easily seen to the right of the container. Towards the bottom of the container the score board is displayed, again keeping the colours consisitent throughout the quiz.
## The Skeleton
The entire quiz is a single page of HTML, making use of the display elemnet to change between the instructions and the content container.
## The Surface
Keeping with the 90s vibe I wanted to use a bubble style font for the main heading but also making sure it was readable on the site. For the body of text I opted for a simple sans serif font 'Work Sans'.

 The colours are consistent throughout the quiz, taking inspiration from the 90s style background.
